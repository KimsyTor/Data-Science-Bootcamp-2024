# Exercise 3: Monopoly Game

# In Monopoly, players can buy properties of two types: houses and hotels.
# A house costs $50 and a hotel costs $100.

# The game has a special offer: 
# if a player buys a hotel, they can get a house for half price.

# Task: Write a function `calculate_property_cost` that takes two arguments: `num_houses` and `num_hotels`.
# The function should calculate the total cost of the properties.

# Reminders: 
# - If the number of hotels is greater than or equal to the number of houses, 
#   the houses should be half price.
# - The function should return a float if there is a discount, and an integer otherwise.

# Hint: Use the `round()` function to round the result to the nearest integer.

def calculate_property_cost(num_houses, num_hotels):
    # Your code here
    pass
   
print("========================================")
print("Welcome to the Monopoly Property Cost Calculator!")
print("========================================")

# Step 1: Share the rules with the user. 

# Step 2: Ask the user to enter the number of houses and hotels they want to buy.

# Step 3: Call the monopoly calculator function with the user's input.

# Step 4: Share the result with the user.
