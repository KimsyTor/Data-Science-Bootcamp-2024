# Exercise 1: The Enchanted Door

# You are in a magical place. The doors here aren't like the ones we're used to. 
# They require a key and a spell to open.

# Your Task: Create a function named 'openMagicDoor' 
# This function will receive two inputs: 'keyTurned' and 'rightSpell'. 
# Both inputs can be either True (yes) or False (no).

# Here's the magic:
# - If the key is turned and the correct spell is spoken, the door opens.
# - If the key isn't turned or the spell is wrong, the door is stuck shut.

# Hint: Use your knowledge of booleans and if-statements to solve this.

def openMagicDoor(keyTurned, rightSpell):
    # Your code here
    pass

print("========================================")
print("Welcome to the Enchanted Door!")
print("========================================")
print("\nIn this enchanted world, doors require more than just a key to open. You must also speak a magical spell!\n")
print("========================================")

# Step 1: Ask the user if they've turned the magic key and store the response.

# Step 2: Ask the user if they've spoken the correct spell and store the response.

# Step 3: Call the openMagicDoor function using the user's responses

# Step 4: Print the results (Is the door open or closed?)
