# Exercise 2: Binary Calculator

# Your friend is working on a project that involves binary numbers. 
# They're having a hard time with the calculations and have asked for your help.

# Your task: Create a Binary Calculator to help them. 

# You'll need to define four functions: 
# 1) `binary_add`
# 2) `binary_subtract`
# 3) `binary_multiply`
# 4) `binary_divide`.

# Reminder: 
# - Each function should take two binary numbers (provided as strings) 
#   and return the result as another binary string.
# - Remember to convert the binary strings to integers using the `int()` function

# Hint: Use the `bin()` function to convert the result back to binary.

def binary_add(a, b):
    # Your code here
    pass

def binary_subtract(a, b):
    # Your code here
    pass

def binary_multiply(a, b):
    # Your code here
    pass

def binary_divide(a, b):
    # Your code here
    pass

print("========================================")
print("Welcome to the Binary Calculator!")
print("========================================")

# Step 1: Ask the user to choose an operation.

# Step 2: Call the binary calculator function based on the user's choice.

# Step 3: Print the result.
