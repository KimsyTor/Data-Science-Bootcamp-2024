# Exercise 3: Personal Library System

# Imagine being the librarian of your own digital library. Exciting, isn't it?
# This program will allow you to add your favorite books, view your growing collection, 
# and even remove books once you're done with them.

# Each book is represented by its title - a simple string.

# In this exercise, we'll explore some fundamental Python concepts: lists, functions, and while-loops.

# 1. Lists: Think of a list as a digital bookshelf. 
# In Python, a list is a collection of items that are ordered and changeable. 
# We'll use a list to store our book collection.

# 2. Functions: Functions are like little machines that perform specific tasks. 
# We'll write functions to add books to our collection, view our entire collection, 
# and remove books when we're done reading them. Functions help keep our code organized and reusable.

# 3. While-loop: A while-loop is like a repeating task until you tell it to stop. 
# We'll use a while-loop to keep asking the user for commands until they choose to quit. 
# It will keep executing its task as long as its condition remains true.



# Step 1: Create an empty list called books

# Step 2: Create a function to add a book to the library

# Step 3: Create a function to view the list of books in the library

# Step 4: Create a function to remove a book from the library

# Step 5: Create a while-loop that asks the user to enter a command (add, view, remove, quit).
