# Exercise 1: Interactive Grocery List

# Imagine you're at the supermarket and you have a list of items to buy. But wait, you forgot to add eggs! 
# And now you've just realized you already have enough rice at home. 
# Wouldn't it be great if you could dynamically manage your grocery list? 

# In this exercise, you're going to build a Python program that does exactly that. 
# You'll be able to add items, remove items, view the current list, and quit the program when you're done. 
# And to make things easier to find, your program will always keep the list sorted alphabetically.

# HINT: Python is case-sensitive, so 'add' and 'Add' would be considered different strings. 
# You might want to use the lower() function to handle this.



# Step 1: Initialize an empty list to store the grocery items.

# Step 2: Use a while-loop to keep the program running until the user decides to quit.

# Step 3: Inside the while-loop, ask the user to enter an action. 
# The actions can be 'add', 'remove', 'view', and 'quit'.

# Step 4: If the user chooses 'add', ask them to enter an item. Add this item to the list.

# Step 5: If the user chooses 'remove', ask them to enter an item to remove. Remove this item from the list.

# Step 6: If the user chooses 'view', show them the current list.

# Step 7: If the user chooses 'quit', end the while-loop.

# Step 8: Outside the while-loop, sort the list alphabetically.

# Step 9: Print the sorted list.
