# Exercise 2: Personal Weather Assistant

# Tired of guessing what to wear? 
# Just enter in the temperature and get instant advice. 

# This Python program will transform the mundane task of 
# checking the temperature into an engaging experience.

# In this exercise, you're going to make a program that suggests what to wear based on the temperature. 

# You'll create different functions for each task: 
# 1. Saying hello to the user
# 2. Asking for the current temperature
# 3. Showing the temperature to the user
# 4. Suggesting what to wear
# 5. Saying goodbye to the user

# This exercise will help you learn how functions work and how to use them to build a bigger program.



# Step 1: Define a function that prints a welcome message to the user. 
# This function doesn't need any parameters.

# Step 2: Define a function that prompts the user to input the current temperature. 
# This function should return the temperature as a float.

# Step 3: Define a function that takes the temperature as a parameter and prints it. 
# This function should format the temperature in a user-friendly way.

# Step 4: Define a function that takes the temperature as a parameter and gives a clothing recommendation. 
# This function should use conditional statements (aka if-elif-else) to check the temperature ranges and 
# print appropriate recommendations.

# Step 5: Define a function that prints a goodbye message to the user. 
# This function doesn't need any parameters.

# Step 6: Implement a while loop that keeps the program running. 
# Inside this loop, call the functions you created in steps 1-5. 
# Also, include a mechanism for the user to exit the loop (and the program).
